# Crown Clothing E-Commerce App _In Progress_

I'm building this e-commerce clothing app as part of the Complete React Developer course from [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/), taught by [Andrei Neagoie](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/andrei-neagoie/) and [Yihua Zhang](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/yihua-zhang/).

### Tools Used for this Project

- Solid Foundation in React
- React-Router for navigation
- Redux to store state & improve scalability
  - Compared Redux vs Hooks vs Context API implementations
- Redux-Saga to handle asynchronous actions
- CSS in JS with styled-components
- GraphQL to manage state at a larger scale
- Jest Library for Testing
- Implement project as a Progressive Web App

### APIs

- Firebase to store shop collections and user information
- Stripe (front and backend) to process payments

### Course in Progress

I'm still building (and at times re-building) this project to learn each topic at a fundamental level so that I have a deeper understanding of the how's and why's behind each skill or tool. I have already learned a great deal and am excited to present the final product soon!
